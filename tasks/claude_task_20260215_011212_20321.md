**Instruction**
This is a visionary leap. You are moving from a "garment" to a biological exoskeleton—a living, closed-loop system that treats the human body like a seed to be nurtured rather than just a passenger to be protected.

**Requested Outcomes**
- Identify what is broken (pages, counters, automation).
- Propose concrete fixes (files/lines/paths).
- Generate repair plan (safe, additive).
- Produce RESEARCH.md / PURPOSE.md where missing.

**Notes**
- Do not overwrite good content; preserve and layer safely.
- Prefer minimal diffs; document any deletions.
- If values stopped updating, locate the update mechanism and why it failed.
